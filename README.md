I was in search of a tool for MacOS that could batch convert Apple IIgs SHR graphics into png format but could not find anything.
In the end I decided to code one myself in Swift. It started with SHR uncompressed graphic files to png format.
Newly added are now HGR and DHGR conversion and output formats like jpg, tiff, gif and heic.
Added graphic formats for Amiga and Atari ST.

NEW version 2 now with image browser
